# Shelter Animal Outcome Prediction

## Project Goal
We aim to predict the final outcomes of animals admitted to the shelter (such as **adoption**, **return**, **transfer**, or **euthanasia**) to support the efficient operation of the shelter.  
By identifying animals with a high probability of **euthanasia** in advance, we can proactively promote them for adoption and take preventive actions.

## Methodology

- Algorithms used:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **K-Means Clustering**

- Parameter Tuning:
  - Tested **5 different parameter combinations** for each algorithm.

- Encoding Methods:
  - **One-Hot Encoding**
  - **Label Encoding**

- Scaling Techniques:
  - **Log Scaling**
  - **Min-Max Scaling**
  - **Standard Scaling**
  - **Robust Scaling**
  - and a total of **8 scaling methods** explored.

## Results

- Selected the **Top 5 models** based on performance.
- Models were evaluated and compared for their effectiveness in predicting final outcomes.

## Purpose

By leveraging predictive modeling, this project aims to help shelters take **data-driven actions**:
- Proactively promote animals with high risk of euthanasia.
- Optimize shelter operations.
- Improve overall animal welfare.
